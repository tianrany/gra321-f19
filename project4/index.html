	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	
	<h2>We strongly believe that the Web has the ability to make a significant impact on people’s lives.</h2>
	
	<p>It can bring us together in new, meaningful ways. It can create new economies and save old ones. It can give us an understanding of our world that was never possible before. It can unite us in service of a higher purpose. All of this potential can be unlocked as long as the right products get built. With this in mind, we want to build products that:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Use the Web to get people off the Web (and out into the world).</li>
		<li>Use the natural connectivity of the Web to create true intimacy.</li>
		<li>Help people save money or make money on things they already own.</li>
		<li>Level the playing field for the individual.</li>
		<li>Spread a little bit of joy (joy is underrated).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>These are long-term pursuits, but we want to be a long-term company. To do so, we need to remember that the most important product is our day-to-day lives. We have to constantly be on the lookout for each other’s well-being and extra vigilant in our self-examination.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Are we waking up most days excited about the work we’re doing and the people we’re doing it with?</li>
		<li>Are we creating products that we are proud of and that we happily use ourselves?</li>
		<li>Are we working at a pace that is sustainable?</li>
		<li>
			<p>Are we building things that reach beyond ourselves and our professional community, and are used by lots of folks who don’t work on the Web?</p>
			<p>Success, for us, is answering “yes” to each of these questions.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
