    <h1>The Starry Sky</h1>
    <p>Have you ever become lost in an unfamiliar city or state? Chances are you used two things to get around: a map and some signposts. In much the same way, these items can help you find your way around the night sky in any season. Fortunately, in addition to the seasonal star charts here, the sky provides us with two major signposts. Each seasonal description will talk about the Big Dipper — a group of seven bright stars that dominates the constellation Ursa Major the Great Bear. Meanwhile, the constellation Orion the Hunter plays a key role in finding your way around the sky from late autumn until early spring.</p>
    <p>Each map portrays the sky as seen from near 35° north latitude at the times shown below. Located on the edges of the map are the four directions: north, south, east, and west. To find stars above your horizon, hold the map overhead and orient it so a direction label matches the direction you're facing. The stars above the map's horizon now match what's in the sky.</p>
    <h2>Exploring the winter sky</h2>
    <p>Winter finds the Big Dipper climbing the northeastern sky, with the three stars of its handle pointing toward the horizon and the four stars of its bowl standing highest. The entire sky rotates around a point near Polaris, a 2nd-magnitude star found by extending a line from the uppermost pair of stars in the bowl across the sky to the left of the Dipper. Polaris also performs two other valuable functions: The altitude of the star above the horizon equals your latitude north of the equator, and dropping a straight line from the star to the horizon points due north.</p>
    <p>Turn around with your back to the Dipper and you'll be facing the diamond-studded winter sky. The second great signpost in the sky, Orion the Hunter, is central to the brilliant scene. Three closely spaced, 2nd-magnitude stars form a straight line that represents the unmistakable belt of Orion. Extending the imaginary line joining these stars to the upper right leads to Taurus the Bull and its orangish 1st-magnitude star, Aldebaran. Reverse the direction of your gaze to the belt's lower left and you cannot miss Sirius the Dog Star — brightest in all the heavens at magnitude -1.5.</p>
    <p>Now move perpendicular to the belt from its westernmost star, Mintaka, and find the red supergiant star Betelgeuse at the upper left of Orion. Nearly a thousand times the Sun's diameter, Betelgeuse marks one shoulder of Orion. Continuing this line brings you to a pair of bright stars, Castor and Pollux. Two lines of fainter stars extend from this pair back toward Orion — these represent Gemini the Twins. At the northeastern corner of this constellation lies the beautiful open star cluster M35. Head south of the belt instead and your gaze will fall on the blue supergiant star Rigel, Orion's other luminary.</p>
